PrestaShop 1.7.5.1 is now available.

This version fixes bugs and regressions of the 1.7.5.0 version. It also integrates the latest security fixes from Symfony, a core dependency. We strongly encourage you to upgrade your shop as soon as possible.

Releasing this version on the upgrade module was delayed. The reason was an incompatibility issue while upgrading from PrestaShop 1.7.5.0 fixed by the module v4.6.0.

Of course, don't forget to backup before.


## Main fixes

* Merchants can now choose if they want the attribute names on the product page title (“Display attributes in the product meta title” in Shop Parameters > SEO & Urls)
* Fixed a bug preventing module developers to extend grids
* Latests security fixes from Symfony
* Fixed visual problems in the BO when using right-to-left languages
* Fixed pagination issues in pages using the new grids
* Switching combinations in the FO is now faster
* Fixed an exception when sending an email in some systems

Since version 1.7.5.1 is a “patch” update to version 1.7.5.0, upgrading from any 1.7.5 version will be easy: features will work better, and modules & themes which worked fine on 1.7.5.0 will work just as well with 1.7.5.1.
Upgrades from a standard 1.7.x version should work just as well.
